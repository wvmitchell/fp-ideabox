# Functional Ideabox

A pedestrian attempt to build out a from scratch ideabox, utilizing functional
principles.

## Running the app

1) Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:wvmitchell/fp-ideabox.git`
2) Install the dependencies: `npm i`
3) Start the app: `npm start`

## Running the tests

Follow the same installation steps as above, then:
1) Run the tests: `npm test`
2) Alternatively, run the tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`

## Functional Programming Commentary

I tried to use as many functional principles in this project as I could, while
also only doing so in spaces that seemed to make sense. The following section is
part reflection, part code tour.

### Pure Functions

### Higher Order Functions

### Closures

### Curried Functions

### Composition

## Application Architecture Commentary

### Data Model vs DOM

### JavaScript file types
